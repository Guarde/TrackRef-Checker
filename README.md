# TrackRef Checker
A simple script to check for duplicate trackRefs in your Custom Songs folder

Since duplicate trackRefs seem to be an issue, I've written a script to identify duplicates.
It comes as a python script (all recent versions, no additional packages needed) or a windows executable.

To use it just drop either of the files in your CustomSongs folder and execute it there.
It will then go through your custom songs and save any duplicates it finds to a "trackRefs.txt" in the same folder

Disclaimer:
It's not pretty but it works :D 
o.o did someone remove them?
